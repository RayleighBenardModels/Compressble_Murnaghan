# Compressble_Murnaghan # Compressble Rayleigh Bénard with a Murnaghan equation of state

This repository provides a script to be used with
[dedalus](http://dedalus-project.org) to model Rayleigh-Bénard
convection using a fully compressible model. The equation of state
(EOS) is of the Murnaghan type and applies well to planetary
interiors. The Prandtl number is assumed infinite, as relevant to
solid planetary mantles. 

Details of the model and results can be found in the paper
